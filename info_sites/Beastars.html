      <p>
        In a world populated by anthropomorphic animals, herbivores and
        carnivores coexist with each other. For the adolescents of Cherryton
        Academy, school life is filled with hope, romance, distrust, and
        uneasiness. The main character is Legoshi the wolf, a member of the
        drama club. Despite his menacing appearance, he has a very gentle heart.
        Throughout most of his life, he has always been an object of fear and
        hatred by other animals, and heâ€™s been quite accustomed to that
        lifestyle. But soon, he finds himself becoming more involved with his
        fellow classmates who have their own share of insecurities and finds his
        life in school changing slowly.
