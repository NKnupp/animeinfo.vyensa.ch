      <p>
        Takemichi Hanagaki is a freelancer that's reached the absolute pits of
        despair in his life. He finds out that the only girlfriend he ever had
        in his life that he dated in middle school, Hinata Tachibana, had been
        killed by the ruthless Tokyo Manji Gang. The day after hearing about her
        death, he's standing on the station platform and ends up being pushed
        over onto the tracks by a herd of people. He closes his eyes thinking
        he's about to die, but when he opens his eyes back up, he somehow had
        gone back in time 12 years. Now that he's back living the best days of
        his life, Takemichi decides to get revenge on his life by saving his
        girlfriend and changing himself that he'd been running away from.
