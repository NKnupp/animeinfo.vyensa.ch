      <p>
        Everyone has a part of themselves they cannot show to anyone else. At a
        time when all nations of the world were involved in a fierce war of
        information happening behind closed doors, Ostania and Westalis had been
        in a state of cold war against one another for decades. The Westalis
        Intelligence Services' Eastern-Focused Division (WISE) sends their most
        talented spy, "Twilight," on a top-secret mission to investigate the
        movements of Donovan Desmond, the chairman of Ostania's National Unity
        Party, who is threatening peace efforts between the two nations. This
        mission is known as "Operation Strix." It consists of "putting together
        a family in one week in order to infiltrate social gatherings organized
        by the elite school that Desmond's son attends." "Twilight" takes on the
        identity of psychiatrist Loid Forger and starts looking for family
        members. But Anya, the daughter he adopts, turns out to have the ability
        to read people's minds, while his wife, Yor, is an assassin! With it
        being in each of their own interests to keep these facts hidden, they
        start living together while concealing their true identities from one
        another. World peace is now in the hands of this brand-new family as
        they embark on an adventure full of surprises.
