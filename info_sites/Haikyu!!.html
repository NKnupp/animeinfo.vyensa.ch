      <p>
        Inspired after watching a volleyball ace nicknamed "Little Giant" in
        action, small-statured Shouyou Hinata revives the volleyball club at his
        middle school. The newly-formed team even makes it to a tournament;
        however, their first match turns out to be their last when they are
        brutally squashed by the "King of the Court," Tobio Kageyama. Hinata
        vows to surpass Kageyama, and so after graduating from middle school, he
        joins Karasuno High School's volleyball teamâ€”only to find that his sworn
        rival, Kageyama, is now his teammate. Thanks to his short height, Hinata
        struggles to find his role on the team, even with his superior jumping
        power. Surprisingly, Kageyama has his own problems that only Hinata can
        help with, and learning to work together appears to be the only way for
        the team to be successful. Based on Haruichi Furudate's popular shounen
        manga of the same name, Haikyuu!! is an exhilarating and emotional
        sports comedy following two determined athletes as they attempt to patch
        a heated rivalry in order to make their high school volleyball team the
        best in Japan.
