      <p>
        Satoru Fujinuma is a 29 year old manga artist struggling to make a name
        for himself following his debut. But, that was not the only thing in his
        life that Satoru was feeling frustrated aboutâ€¦ He has a unique
        supernatural ability of being forced to prevent deaths and catastrophes
        by being sent back in time before the incident occurred, repeating time
        until the accident is prevented. One day, he gets involved in an
        accident that has him framed as a murderer. Desperate to save the
        victim, he sends himself back in time only to find himself as a
        grade-schooler one month before fellow classmate Kayo Hinazuki went
        missing. Satoru now embarks on a new quest: to save Kayo and solve the
        mystery behind her disappearance.
