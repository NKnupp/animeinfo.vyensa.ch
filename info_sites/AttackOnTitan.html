      <p>
        Several hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by titans.
        Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence,
        devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure
        rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by
        walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even
        taller than the biggest of titans. Flash forward to the present and the
        city has not seen a titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his
        foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are
        destroyed by a colossal titan that appears out of thin air. As the
        smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their
        mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single titan
        and take revenge for all of mankind.
